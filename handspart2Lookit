Here, we explore 6-month-old infants’ understanding of words that are typically used as a label for multiple items of the same kind (e.g., hand) versus words that are typically used to label individuals (e.g., Mommy).",
            "procedures": "This is Part 2 of a two-part study; we have created a unique study for your baby to see today, which includes the brief video clips you recorded in Part 1.  First, you will provide verbal consent to participate by recording a video following steps 2 through 4 on the right side of this page (please make sure you read the entire consent form before doing so!).  Then, the study will proceed for your baby to observe, which involves seeing different ‘Mommies’, a dog, baby hands, and adult feet. Your baby will hear your voice labelling the images. We are interested in your baby’s looking behaviour to the screen in response to what they hear. It’s okay if your baby sometimes looks away from the screen, there is no need to redirect their attention. To thank you for participating today, within a week, we will e-mail you a $10 e-gift card to Amazon. If you complete the study today, we would like to follow-up with you when your baby is older (at 18 and 24 months) to check-in about their language development. These follow-ups would involve filling out an online questionnaire hosted on the “Wordbank” platform by MIT. You are not obligated to participate in these follow-ups and may opt-out at any time; we will e-mail you to ask regarding each instance.",

Our annual newsletter can also be found on our website <a href='https://infantstudies.psych.ubc.ca/' target='_blank'>https://infantstudies.psych.ubc.ca/</a>. To thank you for your time, upon completion of both parts of the study, we will send a $10 e-gift card to Amazon to the e-mail address you provide.",

Recent research suggests that babies know much more about words, including able to understand some meanings behind common words in their environment, by 6-months! TODO: add about the hypothesis and prediction (2 lines) \n\n We really appreciate your help with this investigation!\n\n  To thank you for your participation, we will be emailing you a $10 USD Amazon gift card  - this should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm your consent video and check that your child is in the age range for this study. If you don't hear from us by then, feel free to reach out! Each child can only participate once, but if you participate again with another child in the age range, you will receive one gift card per child. \n\n This study has an optional questionnaire follow up when your child is 18 and 24 months old to check-in about their langauge development. These follow-ups would involve filling out an online questionnaire hosted on the Wordbank platform by MIT. You are not obligated to participate in these follow-ups and may opt-out at any time; we will e-mail you to ask regarding each instance.",

If you do not wish for your videos/pictures to shown to any other participants in the study then please select the 'Withdrawal of video data' option below.
