Here, we explore 6-month-old infants’ understanding of words that are typically used as a label for multiple items of the same kind (e.g., hand) versus words that are typically used to label individuals (e.g., Mommy).",

Part 1 may only be completed by mothers with 6-month-old babies.First, you will provide verbal consent to participate by recording a video following steps 2 through 4 on the right side of this page (please make sure you read the entire consent form before doing so!). Then, the study will proceed, which involves recording a few brief video clips: four of yourself and two of your baby’s hand. Next, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address (which we will use to send you Part 2 of the study and to match your questionnaire responses) and to click a link to complete a questionnaire about your baby’s language background and vocabulary. This questionnaire is on the “Qualtrics” platform, hosted by the University of British Columbia in Canada. We will use the video clips you record in this Part 1 to create Part 2 of the study, which will be customized for you and your baby to participate in on another day. Within a week, we will e-mail you a link to a unique version of Part 2 on Lookit, which will be password-protected such that only you may access it.",

(1) In order to integrate your video recordings into Part 2 of the study, we will store the videos in a repository on our Centre’s website <a href='https://infantstudies.psych.ubc.ca/' target='_blank'>https://infantstudies.psych.ubc.ca/</a>. This repository is not linked to within the website and would not appear in google searches. This is necessary because Lookit accesses files on public webpages to display in studies. Upon your participation in Part 2 (or until the participation link expires, whichever comes first), we will delete your videos from the repository. (2) Secondly, we may integrate your videos into Part 2 of the study that we create for another family. For example, in Part 2, your baby will see a video of you alongside a video of another mom, while hearing the word “Mommy”. If you would not consent to release of the videos you record in Part 1, we completely understand; in that case, please exit the study now. We have other studies available that do not involve video release and would be delighted for you to participate in those. <Br><Br>Please note that ‘release’ of the videos for storage our Centre’s website and for display in Part 2 for other families is separate from the privacy level you select for the videos stored on Lookit (in the previous section above).",
